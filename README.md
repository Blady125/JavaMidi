# JavaMidi

This repository contains java code using JavaFX to create a midi synthesizer. 
I am doing this for a class project in college, but I took the liberty to create
my own song just for fun, and to better understand how the code works. This
code initially had about 20 compilation errors I had to fix, and after I did,
I had to figure out which classes implemented which interfaces to better understand
interfaces as well. In theory, you should be able to just put this in a java file and
run it, however, I am still trying to learn GitHub, so sorry if it isn't that simple. 

I don't know how licenses work, but I am fine if anyone uses this to learn more about midi.
Please don't sell this. I don't know why you would, but just use it for educational purpose.
If you want to sell your own midi code, use this to figure out how and then you can make your
own!

Thanks for checking this out, and I hope it was helpful!
